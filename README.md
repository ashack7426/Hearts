# Hearts

#This is the game of the hearts in python. In this game the default is 100 points 
#For rules you can look at this link: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/hearts/
# I have added multiple bots so one can try to play against a computer as well.


# The settings shoulh have 4 players
# Each player is either a human or computer or unknown
# Human means we choose the card to play and they know their hand
# Computers have a way to choose a card to play and they know their own hand
# Unknown means they do not know their own hand (so if I am playing against other real life players)

# At the start of each round I can also change the pass, the default will be the order but just in case it can change
# Min MC - 80% 4th, 10% 2nd, and 10% 3rd
# Random - 25 % win rate
# Bot - 41% 1st, 28 %second, 21% third, 10% 4th
# Max MC - 95 % win rate 5% second place

# Test bots and make guis
# Computer Levels:
# Very easy: Min MC - 80% 4th, 10% 2nd, and 10% 3rd
# Easy: Random - 25 % win rate
# Medium: 5/14 Max MC and 9/14 Random - 50% first, 18% second, 16% third and fourth (in theory)
# Hard: 17/27 Max MC and 10/27 Heart AI - 75% first, 13.5% second, 7.7% third, 3.7% last (in theory)
# Very Hard: Max MC - 95 % win rate 5% second place
